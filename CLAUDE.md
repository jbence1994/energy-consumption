# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PySpark-based ETL data pipeline implementing the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) for energy
consumption analysis. Data flows from a raw CSV through three processing layers into aggregated monthly analytics with
tiered pricing calculations.

## Environment Setup

Dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt` (PySpark 3.5.7). A `.env` file (not committed) configures four path
variables:

```
DATA=             # Path to source CSV file
MEDALLION_BRONZE= # Output path for bronze layer (raw Parquet)
MEDALLION_SILVER= # Output path for silver layer (processed Parquet, partitioned by year/month)
MEDALLION_GOLD=   # Output path for gold layer (aggregated Parquet)
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in local paths before running.

## Running the Pipeline

Run all three layers in sequence with a single command:

```bash
python -m etl.pipeline
```

Individual layers can still be run standalone if needed:

```bash
python -m etl.bronze
python -m etl.silver
python -m etl.gold
```

Layers must be executed in order — each layer reads from the previous layer's output.

## Architecture

### Medallion Layers (`etl/`)

- **`config.py`** — Loads `.env` via `python-dotenv`, validates all four required path variables, and exports them as
  typed string constants (`DATA_PATH`, `BRONZE_PATH`, `SILVER_PATH`, `GOLD_PATH`). Raises `EnvironmentError` on startup
  if any variable is missing.
- **`helpers.py`** — Shared Spark utilities: `get_spark_session()`, `read_csv()`, `read_parquet()`, `write_parquet()`,
  `write_parquet_with_partitions()`. All ETL modules import from here.
- **`pipeline.py`** — Orchestrates the full pipeline: creates a single shared `SparkSession`, calls each ETL function in
  order, then stops the session. Run with `python -m etl.pipeline`.
- **`bronze.py`** — Reads source CSV (with header/schema inference), writes raw data as Parquet to `BRONZE_PATH`. No
  transformations.
- **`silver.py`** — Reads Bronze Parquet, computes `daily_kwh` via PySpark Window functions (`lead` on next day's
  cumulative kWh), drops nulls, writes partitioned by `year`/`month` to `SILVER_PATH`.
- **`gold.py`** — Reads Silver Parquet, aggregates by `year`/`month` (sum, avg, min, max of `daily_kwh`), applies tiered
  pricing (first 210 kWh @ 36 HUF/kWh, remainder @ 70 HUF/kWh), writes to `GOLD_PATH`.

### Data Flow

```
CSV (DATA) → bronze.py → Bronze Parquet → silver.py → Silver Parquet (partitioned) → gold.py → Gold Parquet
```

### Key Business Logic

The tiered pricing in `gold.py` uses a constant `MONTHLY_DISCOUNTED_LIMIT_KWH = 210` to split monthly consumption into
discounted (36 HUF/kWh) and regular (70 HUF/kWh) tiers. Magic numbers for rates are defined as constants at the top of
`gold.py`.
